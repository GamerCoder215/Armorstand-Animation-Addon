## Current Bugs/Wierd Code Behaviour

1. FBX files has slight rotation when imported

2. Having to change the arms and legs to wrong sides. Otherwise the armorstand is doing the movements the wrong way and wrong arm. No idea why it's happening. (I have to change the rotations otherwise they go inward, that's what these lines represent)
